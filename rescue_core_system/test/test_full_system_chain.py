Integration Test: Full System Chain
====================================

This test checks if the entire robot system works together correctly.
It covers communication from sensing (microphone) to thinking (decision making)
to action (motors moving).

We simulate a voice input asking for help, and check if the system processes it.

This test is explained simply for students learning about full robotic systems.

    This test performs these steps:

    1. Create a publisher for the 'audio_in' topic.
    2. Wait until the communicator node is ready to listen.
    3. Publish a fake voice message asking for help.
    4. Allow enough time for the full system to process the message
       (detection, triage, mapping, navigation, actuation).

    This is a big test that ensures all parts of the rescue robot
    are wired correctly and can react as a team.
