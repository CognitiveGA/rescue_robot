Integration Test: Search Tasks to Communicator
===============================================

This test checks if the 'rescue_search_tasks' package correctly sends
audio output to the 'rescue_communicator' package.

A fake command is sent, and we verify that the communicator (speaker)
receives it and can act on it.

This example is written to be simple and easy for new learners.

    This test does the following steps:

    1. Create a publisher that talks on the 'search_rescue_audio_out' topic.

    4. Give the system time to process the message.

    This verifies that after detecting and triaging a victim, the robot can 
    speak important messages to its environment.
