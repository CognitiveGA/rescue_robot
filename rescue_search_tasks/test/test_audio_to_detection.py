Integration Test: Communicator to Search Tasks
===============================================

This test checks if the 'rescue_communicator' package correctly sends
audio input that the 'rescue_search_tasks' package can receive and process.

A fake audio message is sent, and we make sure the communication between
these two packages is set up properly.

This example is made simple for anyone learning robotics communication systems.
